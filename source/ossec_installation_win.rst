Windows agent
=============

This manual is bassed in ossec-hids 2.8.3 version, you can download in the from this sources::

   $ wget https://bintray.com/artifact/download/ossec/ossec-hids/ossec-hids-2.8.3.tar.gz

To download the checksum file, type::

   $ wget https://bintray.com/artifact/download/ossec/ossec-hids/ossec-hids-2.8.3.tar.gz.sha256

Now, let's examine the checksum file with the **cat** command, like so::

   $ cat ossec-hids-2.8.3.tar.gz.sha256

   SHA256 (ossec-hids-2.8.3.tar.gz) = 917989e23330d18b0d900e8722392cdbe4f17364a547508742c0fd005a1df7dd

To generate the SHA256 of the tarball, type::

   $ sha256sum ossec-hids-2.8.3.tar.gz

Expected output::

   917989e23330d18b0d900e8722392cdbe4f17364a547508742c0fd005a1df7dd  ossec-hids-2.8.3.tar.gz


.. warning:: Both checksums need to match, meaning that data has not been corrupted through the download process. If that is not the case, please try it again through a reliable connexion.


Under CentOS
------------

First, you need to install MinGW and nsis (to build the installer). 
For MinGW install epel repository:: 

   $ wget https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
   $ rpm -i epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm

After that, we install MinGW gcc and other libraries for the nsis compilation::

   $ yum install gcc-c++ gcc scons mingw32-gcc zlib-devel

For the nsis installation we need to download two packages::

   $ wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis/files/NSIS%203%20Pre-release/3.0b2/nsis-3.0b2-src.tar.bz2/download
   $ wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis/files/NSIS%203%20Pre-release/3.0b2/nsis-3.0b2.zip/download

After downloading the two packages, I created a directory named 'nsis' in /usr/local.   You can create this diretcory wherever you want, as long as the users who will need it have permissions to access it.  Move the two packages you have just downloaded into the directory 'nsis' that you just have created.  The commands to do this are below::

   $ mkdir /usr/local/nsis
   $ mv nsis-3.0b2-src.tar.bz2 /usr/local/nsis
   $ mv nsis-3.0b2.zip /usr/local/nsis

After moving the files into /usr/local/nsis , extract the two packages.  The commands I used are below::

   $ tar -jxvf nsis-3.0b2-src.tar.bz2 
   $ unzip nsis-3.0b2.zip

The nsis-3.0b2 directory contains a pre-compiled package of the software for Windows. Inside the nsis-3.0b2-src directory will be an INSTALL file.
The program you will be building is called 'makensis'.  This is what will actually build the Installer Package on a Linux box.
Inside the nsis-3.0b2-src directory isssue the following command:: 

   $ scons SKIPSTUBS=all SKIPPLUGINS=all SKIPUTILS=all SKIPMISC=all NSIS_CONFIG_CONST_DATA=no PREFIX=/path/to/your/extracted/zip/directory install-compiler
   $ mkdir /usr/local/nsis/nsis-3.0b2/share
   $ cd /usr/local/nsis/nsis-3.0b2/share
   $ ln -s /usr/local/nsis/nsis-3.0b2 nsis
   $ cp ../bin/makensis /bin

After that we have installed all software necessary for make the Ossec Agent Compilation follow the steps at the `Common compilation`_.



Under Ubuntu & Debian
---------------------

For compile the agent under Ubuntu need to install the next packages::

   $ apt-get install gcc-mingw-w64
   $ apt-get install nsis
   $ apt-get install make

After that we have installed all software necessary for make the Ossec Agent Compilation follow the steps at the `Common compilation`_.

Common compilation
------------------

First unpack ossec-hids::

   $ unzip 2.8.1.zip
   $ cd cd ossec-hids-2.8.1/src/win32
   $ ./gen-win.sh

Now, you will have the win-pkg directory under src. Just go there and run make.sh. Your Windows agent package should be created in a few minutes::

   $ cd ../win-pkg
   $ sh ./make.sh

You will see the following in the screen::

   Making windows agent
