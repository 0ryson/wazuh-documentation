Agent deployment 
----------------

The Wazuh agent runs on the hosts that you want to monitor. It is multi-platform and provides the following capabilities:

- log and data collection,
- file integrity monitoring,
- rootkit and malware detection, and
- security policy monitoring.

In addition, it communicates with the Wazuh manager, sending data in near real-time through an encrypted and authenticated channel.

Sending messages to a remote Server
-----------------------------------

Wazuh agents can run in a wide range of operating systems, but when it is not possible to install an agent due to software incompatibilities or business restrictions, you can forward Syslog events to Wazuh Cloud. This is a common use case for network devices such as routers or firewalls.

Since every communication with Wazuh Cloud is performed trough the Wazuh agent, we will configure the agent to forward the Syslog events. The configuration depends on the operating system, but it involves the following steps:

    1. Setup the syslog listener (rsyslog or Logstash).
    2. Configure the syslog listener to forward the events to a file.
    3. Configure the Wazuh agent to read the previous file.

Forward Syslog events to a Linux agent (via rsyslog)
````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Follow the next steps to receive the syslog events in a Wazuh Linux agent and forward them to the Wazuh Cloud.

1. Configure rsyslog to receive syslog events.

Enable the TCP or UDP settings by editing: /etc/rsyslog.conf

TCP:

.. code-block:: console

    $ModLoad imtcp
    $InputTCPServerRun <PORT>

UDP:

.. code-block:: console

    $ModLoad imudp
    $InputUDPServerRun <PORT>

.. warning::

    Review your firewall/SeLinux configuration to allow this communication.

2. Configure rsyslog to forward events to a file.

Edit /etc/rsyslog.conf:

.. code-block:: console

    # Storing Messages from a remote system into a specific file
    if $fromhost-ip startswith 'xxx.xxx.xxx.' then /var/log/<file_name.log>
    & ~


3.  Deploy a Wazuh agent on the same host that has rsyslog.

4.  Configure the agent to read the syslog output file.

Edit /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf

.. code-block:: console

    <localfile>
      <log_format>syslog</log_format>
      <location>/var/log/<file_name.log></location>
    </localfile>

4.  Restart rsyslog:

.. code-block:: console

    # systemctl restart rsyslog

5.  Restart wazuh-agent:

.. code-block:: console

   # systemctl restart wazuh-agent

Forward Syslog events to a Windows agent (via Logstash)
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Follow the next steps to receive the syslog events in a Wazuh Window agent and forward them to the Wazuh Cloud.

1.   Pre-requisites:

    - Windows fully updated.
    - Java JRE https://www.java.com/es/download/windows-64bit.jsp

2.   Configuring JRE in Windows.

    - Click Start, search for "Environment Variables" and open the system properties applet. The advanced tab of the "System Properties" applet should appear.
    - Click the Environment Variables button.
    - Under System variables click "New".
    - Enter the variable name JAVA_HOME and browse to the JRE install directory and click OK. In variable value it should show the JRE directory. For example, ``C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_201``

3.   Install Logstash

    - Download the Logstash ZIP package from here https://www.elastic.co/downloads/logstash.
    - Extract the ZIP contents to a local folder. For example, to ``C:\logstash\``.

4.   Install logstash-input-syslog and logstash-output-file plugins:

    ``C:\logstash\bin>logstash-plugin install logstash-input-syslog``
    ``C:\logstash\bin>logstash-plugin install logstash-output-file``

5.   Create a configuration file in ``C:\logstash\bin\logstash.conf``.

    Create a blank file from the command line:

    
    ``copy con C:\logstash\bin\logstash.conf``

    ``^Z``

    ``Enter``

    Write this configuration in logstash.conf:

    .. code-block:: console

        input {
          syslog {
            port => <PORT>
          }
        }

        output {
          file {
            path => “C:\logstash\logs\<file_name.log>”
          }
        }

6.   Deploy a Wazuh agent on the same host that has rsyslog.

7.   Edit the agent configuration file to read the logs from the created file:

.. code-block:: console

    <localfile>
       <log_format>syslog</log_format>
       <location>C:\logstash\logs\<file_name.log></location>
    </localfile>

8.   Restart Wazuh agent and run Logstash:

    a. Running Logstash from the shell.

    ``C:\logstash\bin\logstash.bat -f C:\logstash\bin\logstash.conf``

    b. Installing Logstash as a Windows service.

    - Download NSSM: http://nssm.cc/download       
    - Extract the EXE to the BIN directory of the Logstash location.
    - Navigate to the Logstash BIN directory of the Logstash location:
    
            .. code-block:: console

                .\nssm.exe install logstash

        **Path:** Full path of where the LOGSTASH.BAT file is located.

            For example, ``C:\logstash\bin\logstash.bat``

        **Startup Directory:** Full path of the BIN directory.

            For example, ``C:\logstash\bin\``

        **Arguments:** Include the '-f' flag with the path of the logstash config file.

            For example, ``-f C:\logstash\bin\logstash.conf``

        On the details tab ensure the service is set to start up automatically.
        Also on the details tab, ensure the service is set to use a service account.

        Click "Install Service".

    - Start the service: ``C:\logstash\bin\nssm start logstash``
