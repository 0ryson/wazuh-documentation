===========================

In order to make the Wazuh GCP module pull log data from Google Pub/Sub, it will be necessary to provide access credentials so it can connect to them.

Please follow this `link <https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/quickstart-py-mac#create_service_account_credentials>`_ if you need help configuring your GCP credentials JSON file for Google Cloud Pub/Sub.
