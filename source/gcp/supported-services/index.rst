Supported services
==================

  :description: Supported services

All the services get the data pulling logs from Google Cloud Pub/Sub.

In particular, Google Cloud maintains three audit logs for each Google Cloud project, folder and organization:

* **Admin Activity**: Admin Activity audit logs contain log entries for API calls or other administrative actions that modify the configuration or metadata of resources.

* **Data Access**: Data Access audit logs contain API calls that read the configuration or metadata of resources, as well as user-driven API calls that create, modify or read user-provided resource data.

* **System Event**: System Event audit logs contain log entries for Google Cloud administrative actions that modify the configuration of resources. These audit logs are generated by Google system. Therefore, no direct user action will drive them.
