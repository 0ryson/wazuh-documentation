- `OSSEC HIDS <http://ossec.github.io>`_ is a Host based Intrusion Detection System used both to get security visibility and for compliance purposes. Its architecture is based on a multi-platform agent that do forward system data (e.g log messages, file hashes, detected anomalies) to a central system, where it is further analyzed and processed, resulting in security alerts.

+ `OpenSCAP <https://www.open-scap.org>`_ is an OVAL (Open Vulnerability Assessment Language) and XCCDF (Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format) interpreter used to check system configuration and detect vulnerable applications. It is recognized as a standardized compliance and hardening checking solution for enterprise-level infrastructure.

- `Elastic Stack <https://www.elastic.co>`_ is collection of tools (Filebeat, Logstash, Elasticsearch, Kibana) to collect, parse, index, store and search log data. It provides a browser-based visualization frontend interface to easily consume data.
