Installation guide
==================

  :description: Find useful technical documentation about how Wazuh works, suitable for developers and tech enthusiasts.

The Installation guide section includes the :ref:`All-in-One installation <all_in_one>`, which aims to introduce Wazuh by installing it along with Elastic Stack on a single server. The All-in-One installation lacks the high availability and scalability capabilities of a distributed environment, but helps to get familiar with the Wazuh-Elastic Stack environment in its simplest form.

This section, however, will explain how to build a production environment that provides high availability and scalability of the services.

The Introduction document will go through the basic concepts and architecture of the Wazuh production environment.
