  :description: Find useful technical documentation about how Wazuh works, suitable for developers and tech enthusiasts.

A Jumpstart to Wazuh guide is included in the :ref:`Getting started section<all_in_one>`, which aims to introduce Wazuh by installing along with Elastic Stack on a single system (server). It can be used for learning purposes or small production environments, taking into account that it will not benefit from the high availability of a distributed environment.

In this section however, you will find how to build a production environment with data and services high availability, scalability, etc. The introduction document will drive you through the basic concepts and architecture of a Wazuh production environment.
