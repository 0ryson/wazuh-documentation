Concepts
--------

- **Wazuh server:** collects and analyzes data from deployed agents. Consists of: Wazuh manager, Wazuh API and Filebeat.

+ **Elastic Stack**: ingests and indexes data from the Wazuh server. It also provides a flexible visualization tool. Users can create bar graphs, line graphs and scatter plots or pie charts and maps to consolidate and display a large volume of Wazuh data. Consists of: Elasticsearch, Kibana and the Wazuh App. Logstash is optional.

- **Wazuh agent**: runs on the monitored endpoint. Collects endpoint logs, events and configuration data and sends it to the Wazuh server to detect intrusions and anomalies.

+ **Wazuh cluster**: a Wazuh cluster is a group of Wazuh managers that work together to enhance the availability and scalability of the service. With a Wazuh cluster setup, we have the potential to greatly increase the number of agents as long as we add worker nodes whenever necessary.

- **Elasticsearch cluster**:  an Elasticsearch cluster is a group of hosts with Elasticsearch installed with a specific configuration that allows enhancing the availability, scalability and data redundancy of the Elasticsearch service.

Installation types
------------------

The Wazuh server and Elastic stack can be installed and operated in either of these four deployments:

- **Single-host**: the Wazuh server and Elastic Stack subsystems run on a single host.

+ **Wazuh host and Elastic Stack host**: the Wazuh and Elastic Stack subsystems run on separate host systems.

- **Wazuh cluster and Elastic Stack host**: Wazuh can be configured to work in two or more servers (cluster mode) and Elastic Stack in a single host.

+ **Wazuh host and Elastic Stack cluster**: Wazuh run in a single host and Elastic Stack can be configured in three or more servers (cluster mode).

- **Wazuh cluster and Elastic Stack cluster**: Wazuh can be configured to work in two or more servers (cluster mode) and Elastic Stack as well.

.. note::
  Before installing the components, please confirm that the time synchronization service is configured and working on your servers. This is most commonly done with **NTP**.  For more information, go to `Debian/Ubuntu <https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/NTP.html>`_ or `CentOS/RHEL/Fedora/Amazon Linux/Oracle Linux/OpenSUSE/SUSE <http://www.tecmint.com/install-ntp-server-in-centos/>`_.
