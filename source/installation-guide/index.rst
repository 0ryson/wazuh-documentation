Installation guide
==================

.. meta::
  :description: Find useful technical documentation about how Wazuh works, suitable for developers and tech enthusiasts.

A Quickstart installation guide is included in Getting started, which can be found :ref:`here<installation_guide_aio>`. The mentioned guide aims to introduce Wazuh by installing along with  Elastic Stack on a single system (server). It can be used for learning proposes or small production environments, taking into account the non-high availability inconvenience.

Unlike the Quickstart installation guide, here you will find how to build a production environment with data and services high availability, scalability, etc. The introduction document will drive you through the basic concepts and architecture of a Wazuh production environment.
