Concepts
--------

Setting up Wazuh involves the installation of two server subsystems: the Wazuh server and Elastic Stack, along with the Wazuh agents:

- **Wazuh server:** collects and analyzes data from deployed agents. Consists of: Wazuh manager, Wazuh API and Filebeat.

+ **Elastic Stack**: manages the ingest, indexation of data from the Wazuh server.  In addition to this, it provides a flexible visualization tool. Users can create bar, line and scatter plots, or pie charts and maps on top of large volumes of Wazuh data. Consists of: Elasticsearch, Kibana and the Wazuh App. Logstash is optional.

- **Wazuh agent**: runs on the monitored endpoint. Collects endpoint logs, events and configuration data and sends it to the Wazuh server to detect intrusions and anomalies.

Installation types
------------------

The Wazuh server can be installed and operated in either of these two deployments:

- **Single-host server**: the Wazuh server and Elastic Stack subsystems run on a single host.

+ **Multitier server**: the Wazuh and Elastic Stack subsystems run on separate host systems. Wazuh can be configured to work in two or more servers (cluster mode) and Elastic Stack as well.

.. note::
  Before installing the components, please confirm that the time synchronization service is configured and working on your servers. This is most commonly done with **NTP**.  For more information, go to `Debian/Ubuntu <https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/NTP.html>`_ or `CentOS/RHEL/Fedora/Amazon Linux/Oracle Linux/OpenSUSE/SUSE <http://www.tecmint.com/install-ntp-server-in-centos/>`_.
