Servers communication encryption
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

By default, the communications between Wazuh server (Filebeat) and Elastic Stack server (Logstash) are not encrypted. Itâ€™s strongly recommended to configure Logstash to use SSL encryption. Please follow the next guide to setting up SSL for Filebeat and Logstash.

Securing API
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

By default, the communications with the API are not encrypted. You should take the following actions to secure your API:

 - Change default user/password.
 - Enable HTTPS.

You can change these options :ref:`manually <api_configuration>` or run the script ``/var/ossec/api/scripts/configure_api.sh`` in order to configure the basic settings.
