Integrating OSSEC-ELK Stack
=============================================================

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Welcome to OSSEC-ELK Stack integration guide by Wazuh, throught some simple steps you will set up an entire ELK Stack architecture to monitor, collect, process, index and display your OSSEC Alerts.

The full guide is based on OSSEC Wazuh version, we contribute with OSSEC community by developing extended funcionality.

These are some features we are talking about:

* **OSSEC-Wazuh Ruleset**
Weekly OSSEC Ruleset updates
* **OOSSEC PCI DSS 3.0 & CIS Requirements**
Detailed groups and Benchmarks (ex: 1.4 Debian Linux Benchmark, 11.4 PCI...)
* **OOSSEC JSON Custom Output**
Groups array, timestamps, Agents name, locations, file integrity..
* **Logstash input/filter/output plugins**
GeoIP, names format, elasticsearch template, elasticsearch ossec cluster.
* **OElasticsearch**
Custom index mapping template to fit OSSEC alert fields. 
* **OKibana 4**
OSSEC Alerts, PCI Complianace, CIS Compliance, Agents management, Agents Info Dashboards.
Hiding non useful fields, display short summary of PCI Requirements on mouseover on PCI Alerts.
