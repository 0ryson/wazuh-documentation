Simple registration service for MacOS X hosts
=============================================

Open a session in your MacOS X agent host as a root user. After that, you can register the Wazuh agent using ``agent-auth`` as follows:

1. On the agent, run the ``agent-auth`` program. It allows agent registration by simply providing the manager's IP address. In this case, as the agentâ€™s name is not provided, the name is set automatically using hostname:

   .. code-block:: console

      # /Library/Ossec/bin/agent-auth -m <MANAGER_IP>

   You can set the agent's name by adding ``-A`` flag to the command:

   .. code-block:: console

      # /Library/Ossec/bin/agent-auth -m <MANAGER_IP> -A <AGENT_NAME>

   You can adjust the agent registration according to your requirements choosing from available :ref:`agent-auth` options.

2. Edit the agent configuration file. In ``/Library/Ossec/etc/ossec.conf``, in the ``<client><server>`` section, repalce the ``MANAGER_IP`` with the manager IP address:

   .. code-block:: xml

    <client>
      <server>
        <address>MANAGER_IP</address>
        ...
      </server>
    </client>

3. Start the agent.

   .. code-block:: console

      # /Library/Ossec/bin/ossec-control start
