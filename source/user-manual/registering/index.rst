Registering agents
==================

  :description: Learn more about the different methods that can be used to register agents against the Wazuh Manager.

In this section, the registration process is described, and more specifically the different methods that users can use to register agents in the Wazuh Manager.

Prerequisites
-------------

The registration service requires an SSL certificate on the manager in order to work. This certificate will be automatically generated by the package during the installation if the ``openssl`` package is installed. This certificate is stored in ``/var/ossec/etc/sslmanager.cert``.

If you already have a certificate, you can use them just by copying them into the same path:

.. code-block:: console

  # cp <ssl_cert> /var/ossec/etc/sslmanager.cert
  # cp <ssl_key> /var/ossec/etc/sslmanager.key

Otherwise, you can create a self-signed certificate using the following command:

.. code-block:: console

  # openssl req -x509 -batch -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:4096 -out /var/ossec/etc/sslmanager.cert -keyout /var/ossec/etc/sslmanager.key

.. _registration-process:

The registration process
------------------------

Every Wazuh Agent sends data to the Wazuh Manager via a secure way called OSSEC message protocol. This protocol encrypts messages using a pre-shared key. In a fresh install, if you didn't register and configure your agent during the installation time, the agent can't communicate with the manager due to the lack of this pre-shared key.

The registration process consists of a mechanism to create a trusted relationship between the Manager and an Agent. This process could be done in a Manager itself or with a registration service. This service runs on the Manager, where an Agent could request a pre-shared key using some credentials. The Manager will reply with the key and store the new Agent in a local database.

Another approach is using the Wazuh API, this is just a wrapper for local registration on Wazuh Manager.

Agent keys
^^^^^^^^^^

The manager uses the file ``/var/ossec/etc/client.keys`` to store the registration record of each agent, which includes ID, name, IP, and key. Example::

    001 Server1 any e20e0394dca71bacdea57d4ca25d203f836eca12eeca1ec150c2e5f4309a653a
    002 ServerProd 192.246.247.247 b0c5548beda537daddb4da698424d0856c3d4e760eaced803d58c07ad1a95f4c
    003 DBServer 192.168.0.1/24 8ec4843da9e61647d1ec3facab542acc26bd0e08ffc010086bb3a6fc22f6f65b

The agents also have the file ``/var/ossec/etc/client.keys`` containing only their own registration record. Example for ``Server1`` agent::

    001 Server1 any e20e0394dca71bacdea57d4ca25d203f836eca12eeca1ec150c2e5f4309a653a

**Basic data for registering an agent**

In order to register an agent, it is necessary to provide the name and the IP of the agent.

There are several ways to set the agent IP:

 - **Any IP**: Allow the agent to connect from any IP address. Example: ``Server1`` has ``any`` IP.
 - **Fixed IP**: Allow the agent to connect only from the specified IP. Example: ``ServerProd`` has the IP ``192.246.247.247``.
 - **Range IP**: Allow the agent to connect from the specified range of IPs. Example: ``DBServer`` has the IP range ``192.168.0.1/24``.

Some registration methods automatically detect the IP of the agent during the registration process.
