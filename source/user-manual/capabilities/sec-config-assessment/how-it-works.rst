State vs alerts
---------------

Agents have their own local database inf the form of a hash table where they store the state of each check: *passed* or *failed*. It allows the agent to send
only the differences between each scan, if nothing has changed from the last scan, only the summary will be send, avoiding network flooding every time 
a scan ends.

On the manger side, the results for each check are stored in the agents sqlite database. This allows to find out if the state of a check has changed between scans, avoiding
if it has changed then an altert is generated for that check.


Available information of scans
------------------------------

Queriable information of the scans
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Every scan comes along with useful information about it. The JSON format is used to send the agents events to the manager.
There are basically three types of events:

- Check event
- Summary event
- Enabled policies event


Example of a check event:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "type":"check",
        "id":574369125,
        "policy":"CIS benchmark for Debian/Linux",
        "policy_id":"cis_debian",
        "check":{
            "id":5040,
            "title":"Ensure root is the only UID 0 account",
            "description":"Any account with UID 0 has superuser privileges on the system.",
            "rationale":"This access must be limited to only the default root account and only from the system console. Administrative access must be through an unprivileged account using an approved mechanism as noted in Item 5.6 Ensure access to the su command is restricted.",
            "remediation":"Remove any users other than root with UID 0 or assign them a new UID if appropriate.",
            "compliance":{
                "cis_csc":5,
                "cis":"6.2.5",
                "pci_dss":"10.2.5"
            },
            "file":"/etc/passwd",
            "result":"passed"
        }
    }


Example of a summary event:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "type":"summary",
        "scan_id":1842155950,
        "name":"System audit for SSH hardening",
        "policy_id":"system_audit_ssh",
        "file":"system_audit_ssh.yml",
        "description":"Guidance for establishing a secure configuration for SSH service vulnerabilities.",
        "references":"https://www.ssh.com/ssh/",
        "passed":4,
        "failed":5,
        "score":44.4444465637207,
        "start_time":1551690624,
        "end_time":1551690624,
        "hash":"7dbcf50b5b508320e0de6467953ee4e8"
    }


Example of an enabled policies event:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "type":"policies",
        "policies":[
            "cis_debian",
            "system_audit",
            "system_audit_ssh"
        ]
    }

The information of the different types of events are stored on the manager side inside the agents sqlite database. The database has the following tables:

+------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Table                        | Description                                                                               |
+------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| sca_policy                   | Stores the information about the policy file itselt. Related to the summary event         |
+------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| sca_scan_info                | Stores the information about the scan. Related to the summary event                       |
+------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| sca_check                    | Stores the information about the check. Related to the check event                        |
+------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| sca_check_compliance         | Stores the information about the compliances of a check event. Related to the check event |
+------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


Check status
^^^^^^^^^^^^

A scan event has two different states, they can be ``passed`` or ``failed``. A ``failed`` status is set when the check requirements aren't met.
Take the following example from the cis file ``cis_debian_linux_rcl.yml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

 # Section 3.1 - Network Parameters (Host Only)
 - id: 5031
   title: "Ensure IP forwarding is disabled"
   description: "The net.ipv4.ip_forward and net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding flags are used to tell the system whether it can forward packets or not."
   rationale: "Setting the flags to 0 ensures that a system with multiple interfaces (for example, a hard proxy), will never be able to forward packets, and therefore, never serve as a router."
   remediation: "Set the following parameter in /etc/sysctl.conf or a /etc/sysctl.d/* file: net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0, net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding = 0"
   compliance:
    - cis_csc: "5.1"
    - cis: "3.1.1"
   condition: any
   rules:
     - 'f:/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward -> 1;'
     - 'f:/proc/sys/net/ipv6/ip_forward -> 1;'

The following event is send:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "type":"check",
        "id":574369125,
        "policy":"CIS benchmark for Debian/Linux",
        "policy_id":"cis_debian",
        "check":{
            "id":5031,
            "title":"Ensure IP forwarding is disabled",
            "description":"The net.ipv4.ip_forward and net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding flags are used to tell the system whether it can forward packets or not.",
            "rationale":"Setting the flags to 0 ensures that a system with multiple interfaces (for example, a hard proxy), will never be able to forward packets, and therefore, never serve as a router.",
            "remediation":"Set the following parameter in /etc/sysctl.conf or a /etc/sysctl.d/* file: net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0, net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding = 0",
            "compliance":{
                "cis_csc":5,
                "cis":"3.1.1"
            },
            "file":"/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward,/proc/sys/net/ipv6/ip_forward",
            "result":"passed"
        }
    }

The *result* is ``passed`` because the ``rules`` are looking for a ``1`` inside the ``/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward`` file or the ``/proc/sys/net/ipv6/ip_forward``. 
As we have the value ``0`` in both files, the result is marked as ``passed``.


Enabled policies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each agent will send the policies it has enabled, so the manager can compare them with the agent database and erase the disabled policies (if any).

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "type":"policies",
        "policies":[
            "cis_debian",
            "system_audit",
            "system_audit_ssh"
        ]
    }

The ``sca_policy`` table will be queried, comparing the existing policies with the policies from the event above.


Integrity mechanism
-------------------

To maintain the correct correlation between the agent state for each check and the managers database for that agent, an integrity mechanism has been developed.

Let's look how it works with an example.

On the agent side we have the following hash table:

+------------------------------+----------------+
| Check ID                     | State          |
+------------------------------+----------------+
| 1000                         | passed         |
+------------------------------+----------------+
| 1001                         | failed         |
+------------------------------+----------------+
| 1002                         | failed         |
+------------------------------+----------------+
| 1003                         | passed         |
+------------------------------+----------------+

It will send an MD5 hash inside the summary event with the result of the concatenation ``passed,failed,failed,passed`` being it ``C97B411C70B9F38FB20BA0458FDCE7A3``.

On the ``manager`` side, let's asume the database is as follows:

+------------------------------+----------------+
| Check ID                     | State          |
+------------------------------+----------------+
| 1000                         | passed         |
+------------------------------+----------------+
| 1001                         | failed         |
+------------------------------+----------------+
| 1003                         | passed         |
+------------------------------+----------------+

The ID 1002 is missing, so the concatenation ``passed,failed,passed`` produces the MD5 hash ``02A7C566386C09071B563B90332DB65C``.
As the MD5 of the agent ``C97B411C70B9F38FB20BA0458FDCE7A3`` and the MD5 of the manager ``02A7C566386C09071B563B90332DB65C`` do not match, the manager will request a full database dump to the agent.


Starting to work
----------------

During a policy file scan it follows the steps described below:

- Load and parse the policy file
- Check if the requirements are meet (if any)
- Execute each rule defineded for each check
- Compare the result for every check with the internal database
- If it has changed, send an alert to the manager and update the database
- Send the policy summary
- Send the enabled policies
