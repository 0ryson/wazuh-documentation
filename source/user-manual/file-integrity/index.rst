File integrity monitoring
==========================

File Integrity monitoring is the capabilitie that allows us to know if any file has changed. The component responsible for this task is called **syscheck**. This component, compares the cryptographic checksum of a known good file against the checksum of the same file after it has been modified.

Syscheck is configured in :ref:`ossec.conf <reference_ossec_conf>`. If you want more information about the exactly configuration options go to :ref:`Syscheck <reference_ossec_syscheck>`. Usually yo use the following sections: :ref:`frequency <reference_ossec_syscheck_frequency>`, :ref:`directories <reference_ossec_syscheck_directories>`, :ref:`ignore <reference_ossec_syscheck_ignore>`, :ref:`alert_new_files <reference_ossec_syscheck_alert_new_files>`

How it works
------------

Syscheck is essential for the intrusion detection.

1. Wazuh agent scans the system and sends the checksums of the monitored files to the Wazuh manager. For this scan, we can configure:

  - **Frequency**: By default configured to run every 6 hours, but entirely configurable by the user.
  - **Real-time monitoring**: Wazuh supports realtime monitoring on servers running Windows or Linux. It's important to remark that the real time option is only configurable for directories, no single files.

2. Wazuh manager stores the checksums and looks for modifications by comparing the new checksums against the old checksums of that file or registry key. It's possible to configure syscheck to report the changes in the content of a text file (only for Linux hosts).

3. In case of an anomaly, an alert is generated.

  It's posible to handle false positives using some configuration options like ``ignore`` or with the creation of rules that controls those files that are excluded.

Alert example, generated by **syscheck**:
::
